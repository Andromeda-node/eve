# eve

Eve is a modern cosmos-sdk blockchain.

* genesis:
  * embedded in binary after launch
  * no "dev fund"
  * community tax set to 20% initally
  * 1 validator = 1 eve
  
  
* pebbledb by default
* cosmwasm
* token factory
* variable length blocks made on demand with a 3 minute heartbeat
* highly selective genesis validator set limited to contributors
* 50 validators


## Imperative

From eve will flow new designs and techniques that increase development velocity and ease of use across cosmos.
